Once your request is processed, your account and associated data will be permanently deleted.

## Reset Data

If you wish to reset your data without deleting your account, we can assist you with this as well. All your personal data, such as weight records, measurements, notes, etc., will be erased while your account remains active. To do this, please reach out to us at support@dalvik.studio or use the app itself: Go to 'Settings', then 'Profile', and select 'Reset Data'. Following your request, your data will be reset promptly.
