In no event shall Weyt or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the App, even if Weyt or a Weyt authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
